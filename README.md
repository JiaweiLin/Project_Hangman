Hangman is a ReactJS game that was built using Amazon Q Developer. The objective of this Hangman game is to guess the word in each round. There are 6 rounds in total. Player has 6 lives in each round. This game has single player mode and two-player mode. For two-player mode, there is a time-limit (20 sec, 25 sec or 30 sec).

This application integrates with Amazon Bedrock to generate words for the selected Hangman category. The game is hosted on AWS Amplify. I created this game to participate in the AWS Game Builder Challenge 2024.
